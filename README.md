# SARS-CoV-2 Contextual Data Specification - Collection template and associated materials for SARS-CoV-2 metadata
 
Public health genomics contextual data includes sample metadata, lab/clinical/epidemiological data, and methods information. Contextual data enables the interpretation of the sequence data, informs decision making for public health responses, and facilitates scientific understanding of infectious disease. 

Contextual data that are structured and consistent, particularly complying with community standards like minimum information checklists (MIxS, MIGS, Sample Application Standard) and ontologies (OBO Foundry), can be more easily understood and processed by both humans and computers, and can be more easily aggregated and reused for different types of analyses.

In the face of the current pandemic, PHA4GE has identified a clear and present need for a fit-for-purpose, open source SARS-CoV-2 contextual data standard. As such, we have developed a SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification based on harmonizable, publicly available, community standards. The specification is implementable via a collection template, as well as an array of protocols and tools to support the harmonization and submission of sequence data and contextual information to public repositories.

The PHA4GE SARS-CoV-2 Contextual data collection template can be used for data management, and consists a spreadsheet-based collection template, a reference guide, and a controlled vocabulary list. This information does not have to be shared, but sharing with public repositories is encouraged when permitted.
Fields are grouped according to whether they describe sampling, host information (symptoms, exposures etc), sequencing, bioinformatics and quality control metrics, etc. The collection template contains "required" (colour-coded yellow), strongly recommended (colour-coded purple) and optional (colour-coded white) fields. In many fields, picklists of ontology-mapped controlled vocabulary are offered to better standardize data values. 
Field definitions, further guidance/instructions, and examples of structured data can be found in the Reference Guide tab.
